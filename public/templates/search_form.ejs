  <h3>Tell us about it!</h3>

  <p>The <a href='#'>Austin Universal Recycling Ordinance</a> has been in place since October 2013 starting with units with 50 or more dwellings.  By October 2017 all multifamily residential properties must comply with this ordinance and have a recycling program in place for their residents.</p>
  <p>We want to hear from you on whether your building is offering their residents recycling!</p>
